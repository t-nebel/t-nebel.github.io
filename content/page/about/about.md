**Hey there! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm **Tobias Nebel** from the beautiful [Ruhr area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr) in Germany. 

Since 2021, I've been working as a Cloud Solution Architect at [glueckkanja](https://www.glueckkanja.com), where I focus on Microsoft cloud technologies and communication solutions.

My journey in the Microsoft Voice world started back in 2014 with **Lync** â€“ remember that? If you don't, consider yourself lucky. I've survived the evolution through **Skype for Business** and now live happily in the **Microsoft Teams** era, with **AudioCodes** solutions very often part of the mix.

Currently, I work primarily on **Microsoft Teams Voice** projects, often integrating **AudioCodes** solutions to create seamless communication experiences. I'm also passionate about **PowerShell automation**, which helps turn repetitive tasks into elegant scripts (and saves me from doing things manually).

This blog is where I share my adventures (and occasional misadventures) with **Microsoft Teams Voice**, **AudioCodes** implementations, **PowerShell automation**, and whatever other tech rabbit holes I happen to fall into. I focus particularly on sharing practical scripts for these areas, along with other technical insights I encounter along the way. My aim is to provide solutions and experiences that might help others working in similar environments.
